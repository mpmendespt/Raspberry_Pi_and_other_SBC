![me](/images/eu_4.jpg)
I am an electronics technician in the Portuguese Air Force. In this scope I worked in the maintenance of various systems including: 
Radio communications HF, VHF, MW (microwave); Multiplexing (TDM and PCM); Optical Fiber; Data communication networks (LAN); Subsystem of communications of the Portuguese Air Command and Control System (POACCS); Ground controlled approach (GCA); Tactical air navigation system (TACAN); Telephone exchanges (PBX), etc.

Also, I am an autodidact with an interest in many study areas.

This blog is a test space for anything related to Raspberry Pi and other single-board computers (SBC).  </br>
And as a test space it´s running on a small Raspberry Pi Cluster (now as start project with only 3 Raspberry Pi’s).
